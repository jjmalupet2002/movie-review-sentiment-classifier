# movie-review-sentiment-classifier

Project Overview
Project Title: Movie Review Sentiment Classifier
Summary
Develop a Python-based machine learning tool to classify movie reviews into sentiments (e.g., positive or negative). The tool leverages text preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning (e.g., scikit-learn classifiers). You will also apply Software Quality Assurance (SQA) techniques, including unit tests and system validation.

Objectives
Main Objectives
Develop a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.


Apply and demonstrate SQA practices, including manual unit tests and system validation tests.


Visualize model performance using data analysis tools (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy plots).



Secondary Objectives
Gain familiarity with text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopwords removal, vectorization).


Evaluate and compare multiple models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).


Create clear and reproducible documentation and code structure.



Project Setup & Components
Required Components
1️⃣ Dataset
A labeled dataset of movie reviews (text) with sentiment labels (positive/negative).


Dataset used:


IMDb movie review dataset
About Dataset- IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.


2️⃣ Environment Setup
Python 3.8+ (recommend virtual environment).


Install:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib nltk


If using notebooks, also:

pip install jupyter
