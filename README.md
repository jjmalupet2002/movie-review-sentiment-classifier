# movie-review-sentiment-classifier

Develop a Python-based machine learning tool to classify movie reviews into sentiments (e.g., positive or negative). The tool leverages text preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning (e.g., scikit-learn classifiers). You will also apply Software Quality Assurance (SQA) techniques, including unit tests and system validation.
